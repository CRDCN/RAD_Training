# Title

The name or title used to identify a resource.

# Description

A human-readable explanation or overview of the dataset's content, purpose, methodology, and any other relevant information. Descriptions often include the objectives of the dataset, how it was collected, processed, and any limitations or recommendations for its use. This field is crucial for understanding the context, scope, and applicability of the dataset, enabling users to assess its relevance and utility for their needs.

# Creators

The creator refers to one or more entities that are primarily responsible for the creation and management of the dataset. A creator can be a person or organization and may have an affiliation.

Using ORCID to identify creators simplifies the recognition and attribution process while providing a more comprehensive view of their work and affiliations.

## ORCID iD

ORCID iDs are persistent identifiers for individual researchers, enabling their work and affiliations to be identified across institutions. ORCID iDs also disambiguate researchers who have similar names. The use of ORCID iDs ensures accurate attribution and allows organizations to better track the contributions of their affiliated researchers.

## Affiliation

Affiliation refers to the formal association of a creator, such as a person or company, with another entity for the purpose of publishing datasets. This association is typically established through partnerships, collaborations, or memberships, enabling the creator to contribute to or release datasets as part of a collective effort. 

# Contributors

A Contributor is any individual or institution that played a role in the collection, management, distribution, or development of a dataset, but was not one of the dataset’s creators. This role encompasses a wide range of activities other than the primary creation of the data, including but not limited to its maintenance, publication, and dissemination.

# Series

The Series Lunaris field indicates any collections within a repository in which a dataset is included. These series are generally coherent collections of related data organized systematically.

# Publisher

The publisher is the entity responsible for making the resource available, encompassing roles such as holding, archiving, publishing, distributing, or releasing the content.

# Access

Access to datasets refers to the ability of users to retrieve, view, or use data stored within a database, repository, or archive. This involves mechanisms and permissions that allow individuals to locate and utilize the data. Dataset access can range from open access, where data is freely available to anyone, to restricted access, which requires specific credentials or authorization due to privacy, security, or proprietary considerations.

Non-open access datasets are displayed with a lock icon in Lunaris search.

# Rights

The Rights field details the legal permissions, restrictions, and principles for accessing, using, distributing, and reproducing research datasets. It outlines intellectual property rights, licensing conditions, copyright ownership, open access licences (e.g., Creative Commons), and citation requirements. Its goal is to inform users about legal data usage, ensuring compliance with standards and promoting responsible data sharing and reuse.

# URL

The address of the item’s landing page, which offers access to detailed information on a dataset, article, or document. It hosts essential metadata such as the work's title, authors, publication date, abstract, and keywords for a succinct content summary. Additionally, the page frequently includes direct links for downloading or accessing the complete dataset, article, or document.

# Publication Date

The publication date describes the date when the (meta)data was made available to researchers or for citation.

# Subject

Concisely lists the main topics, themes, or areas the dataset covers. For example, a dataset on ocean pollution might include terms like "plastic waste," "marine ecosystems," and "pollution effects." This field aids in categorizing and locating datasets within databases, improving access and relevance for specific research or applications.

Difference between subject and keywords fields:  
While both fields aim to improve the dataset's discoverability, the subject field does so through a more standardized approach, whereas the keywords field allows for a broader, more user-driven description.

# Keywords

Keywords are short free-text words or phrases that a dataset publisher has highlighted as being relevant to the dataset.

Difference between subject and keywords fields:  
While both fields aim to improve the dataset's discoverability, the subject field does so through a more standardized approach, whereas the tags field allows for a broader, more user-driven description.

# Identifier

An identifier is a unique string that distinguishes a specific record, item, or resource within a database or system. It plays a crucial role in facilitating access, tracking, and management, and can manifest in forms that include letters, digits, or symbols. Identifiers promote consistent identification across various platforms, with examples like DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers), Handles (Handle Systems), and ARKs (Archival Resource Keys). Our focus is on harnessing global identifiers, like DOIs, presented in a standardized PID URL format (e.g., https://doi.org/{unique\_identifier}), to streamline resource access. However, such standardized PID URLs might not always be universally implemented across repositories. Consequently, we identify three primary types of identifiers to ensure thorough resource identification:

1. Standardized PIDs, which are overseen by dedicated PID management platforms, including DOI, Handle, ArcGIS, and ISBN.  
2. Repository-specific identifiers, which are governed by the repositories that also host the corresponding datasets.  
3. Internal identifiers, employed in instances lacking formal PID management. In these cases, we select the most informative alternative, generally an internal ID utilized by the repository for identifying the resource.

This methodology aims to guarantee straightforward access and as accurate identification of resources as possible.

# Geospatial Boxes

Specifies the dataset's geographical boundaries through four coordinates: northernmost and southernmost latitudes, and easternmost and westernmost longitudes. This configuration outlines a rectangular area on Earth, defining the geographical coverage of the dataset. Lunaris uses this information for map searches, enabling users to find datasets that overlap with specified map boundaries via the user interface.

# Geospatial Place Names

Refers to a specific geographic location or area associated with the dataset. This can be described as free text that describes where the data is located or applicable. 

# Geospatial Points

Refers to specific geographic locations, each represented by a pair of coordinates: latitude and longitude. This combination of latitude and longitude values pinpoints precise spots on the Earth's surface. The geopoints provide spatial information that helps identify the exact locations of the dataset's subject matter, facilitating geospatial analysis, mapping, and other geographical interpretations.
